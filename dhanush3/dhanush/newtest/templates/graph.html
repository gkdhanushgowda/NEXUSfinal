        <h2>1940s-1950s</h2>
        <p>The mid-20th century saw significant industrialization and economic growth after World War II. Carbon emissions were primarily from the burning of fossil fuels for energy in industries, transportation, and households.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>1960s-1970s</h2>
        <p>Environmental awareness began to rise, with concerns about pollution and its impact on health. Governments started implementing regulations to address air pollution, but carbon emissions continued to rise.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>1980s</h2>
        <p>Global attention shifted to the issue of climate change, with the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988. The link between human activities and rising greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide, gained recognition.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>1990s</h2>
        <p>The 1990s saw the signing of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, marking an international effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide. Efforts to transition to renewable energy sources gained momentum.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2000s</h2>
        <p>As the 21st century began, awareness of climate change impacts grew. International agreements like the Paris Agreement in 2015 aimed to limit global warming. Despite efforts, carbon emissions continued to rise due to increased industrialization and demand for energy.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2010s</h2>
        <p>The 2010s marked a significant push towards renewable energy sources, with advancements in solar and wind technologies. Despite these efforts, global carbon emissions reached record levels, contributing to the ongoing challenges of climate change.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2020-2023</h2>
        <p>In the early 2020s, the world faced unprecedented challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic. While the pandemic temporarily reduced carbon emissions due to lockdowns and reduced economic activity, emissions rebounded as economies recovered. Ongoing efforts to address climate change focused on sustainable practices, renewable energy, and international cooperation.</p>
